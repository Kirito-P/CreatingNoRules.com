		<h2>Why it was created!</h2>		
		<p>This is to show all that they can Live there best live by <em>Creating No Rules</em>. There are many ways to live your best life. Iâ€™m here to show you how to create it.
		With having many year not having any reason to live and not knowing what I need to do in my life. when I did finally decide I wanted a <i>new live, a better life, the best life.</i>. 
		I decide I needed some thing different, something new, so I sat down and decide I needed to <b>create no rules</b> for myself. If I wanted to do it I needed to find a way to stop the negative about why it cant be done.
		So <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creatingnorules/?ref=bookmarks">#CreatingNoRules</a> was thought up.
